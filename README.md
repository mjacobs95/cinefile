## Graphical actor and movie linking software

This is software that automatically links two movies or two actors via the shortest path of actors and movies it can find. It does this by iteratively making requests to [The Movie Database (TMDB) API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) and building a network until the two original nodes are connected.
